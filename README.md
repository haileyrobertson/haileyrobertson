## Hi! I'm Hailey 👋

📚 I'm a PhD student in the [Grubaugh lab](https://grubaughlab.com/) and [Carlson lab](https://carlsonlab.bio/) at Yale University, and an NSF Graduate Research Fellow. 

🦠 My PhD research centers around how we can understand and predict transmission dynamics for arthropod and zoonotic diseases using mathematical and computational tools 📈 I also spend time thinking about ecological networks, artificial intelligence, global health governance, and sustainable development and finance.

🗂️ On my GitHub, you'll find work from my various research projects and classes – these will mostly be at the intersection of disease ecology, global health, and climate change, but I often branch across disciplines! You can learn more about me [here](https://haileyrobertson.com)
